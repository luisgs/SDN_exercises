Objetives:

This application should be able to perform the points below:
    + Layer 2
        - MAC authentication
            If the host has the MAC listed in our matrix, it can use internet communicate.

            I have added a host with a specific MAC address that it will not get access. This MAC address is listed in my black list.
        Optional.
        - VLAN assignation
            All the host that have been granted before will get into the same VLAN ID.
    + Layer 3
        - ACLs
            I will confirm that source and destination IP address can comunicate to each other.
    + Layer 4
        - Redirect traffic depending on the TCP's port used
            As it is written in the exervise traffic will be redirect depending on the ports used. TCP=80 will go trough the higher bandwidth link.
    + Layer 5
        - DPI - Deep packet inspection.
            Basically, I will try to read TCP packets' payload and look for a specific word.
