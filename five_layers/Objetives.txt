Objetives:

This application should be able to perform the points below:
    + Layer 2
        - MAC authentication
            If the host has the MAC listed in our matrix, it can use internet to communicate.

            I switch off the phisical port
                https://www.opennetworking.org/images/stories/downloads/sdn-resources/onf-specifications/openflow/openflow-spec-v1.0.0.pdf
            Therefore, 
            I have added a host with a specific MAC address that it will not get access. This MAC address is listed in my black list.

            Test:   pingall
                    it has to ping all the machines but h5 has to remain unreachable for all of them.
    + Layer 3   IPV4
        - ACLs
            it confirms that IP source is allowed to communicate and
            it confirms that IP connection (source, destination) is allowed to communicate. ACL source can get the destination IP address.
            in case of it is not possible. drop packets.
            
            Test:   IP traffic is dropped. Ostinato or iperf
    + Layer 4
        - Redirect traffic depending on the TCP's port used
            As it is written in the exercise, traffic will be redirect depending on the TCP ports used. TCP=80 will go trough the higher bandwidth link.
            Test:   IPerf has to demostrate your thesis. TCP 80 high bandwidth, the rest only 1mb
    + Layer 5
        - DPI - Deep packet inspection.
            Basically, I will try to read TCP packets' payload and look for a specific word.
            Test:   YOu need to be able to read wordforbiddens... Ostinato generate TCP 80 packet.
