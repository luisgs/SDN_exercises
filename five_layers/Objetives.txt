Objetives:

This application should be able to perform the points below:
    + Layer 2
        - MAC authentication
            If the host has the MAC listed in our matrix, it can use internet to communicate.

            I switch off the phisical port
                https://www.opennetworking.org/images/stories/downloads/sdn-resources/onf-specifications/openflow/openflow-spec-v1.0.0.pdf
            Therefore, 
            I have added a host with a specific MAC address that it will not get access. This MAC address is listed in my black list.
        Optional.
        - VLAN assignation
            All the host that have been granted before will get into the same VLAN ID.
    + Layer 3   IPV4
        - ACLs
            it confirms that IP source is allowed to communicate and
            it confirms that IP connection (source, destination) is allowed to communicate
            in case of it is not possible. drop packets.
    + Layer 4
        - Redirect traffic depending on the TCP's port used
            As it is written in the exercise, traffic will be redirect depending on the TCP ports used. TCP=80 will go trough the higher bandwidth link.
    + Layer 5
        - DPI - Deep packet inspection.
            Basically, I will try to read TCP packets' payload and look for a specific word.
